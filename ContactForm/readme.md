This repo is built on CodingNepal's design using phpmailer.
You can find the original design of CodingNepal here: https://www.codingnepalweb.com/create-working-contact-form-in-php/

NOTES :
In order not to get stuck with the SMTP settings, you can send an e-mail to yourself from your own e-mail address, where you enter the settings in the username-password field. User e-mail can be entered to reply. You can print sender information in msgHTML; even a draft HTML file can be created and attached to it.
